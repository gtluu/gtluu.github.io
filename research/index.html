            <p>My research interests include the use of analytical techniques in order to elucidate the chemistry used for signaling in different organisms. Additionally, I am interested in the use and development of computation strategies and software that address the increasing difficulty of analysis due to the ever increasing size and complexity of the datasets generated from these experiments.</p>
            <p>Chances are, at some point in your life, you've eaten cheese. But have you ever thought about what's on the cheese that you eat? The cheese rind microbiome, consisting of about a dozen micrboes per rind, is relatively simple and well conserved. Despite its relative simplicity, the interactions between different species are often unpredictable in microbial communities larger than two species. Therefore, I am currently studying these complex communities to identify secondary metabolites responsible for chemical communication in complex communities from the cheese rind microbiome and determine how that might affect human health using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics.</p>
            <p>High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most prevalent and one of the most lethal types of ovarian cancer. Due to the difficulty of detection in the early stages of disease, many women are often undiagnosed until the cancer is severe. I seek to identify biomarkers associated with the early stages of HGSOC that can be used to diagnose women before the disease has progressed to an uncurable state using mass spectrometry-based proteomics.</p>
